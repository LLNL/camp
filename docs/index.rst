Camp (Compiler Agnostic MetaProgramming) is a portable C++ Library
that provides modern C++ structures and algorithms that can be used on a variety of 
backend architectures. Camp is part of the RAJA Portability Suite and is developed 
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This project 
collects a variety of macros and metaprogramming facilities for C++ projects.  
Camp focuses on wide compiler compatibility across HPC systems. 

Camp aims to be primarily header-only, with only one small implementation file.
